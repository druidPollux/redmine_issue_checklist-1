redmine_issue_checklist
=======================

Git mirror of the Redmine Issue Checklist plugin, as I couldn't find one.
* Homepage: http://redminecrm.com/projects/checklist
* Redmine: http://www.redmine.org/plugins/issue_checklist

Found an old repo, with a mod to _copy checklist when issue is copied_
* old repo: https://github.com/belike81/Redmine-Issue-Checklist-Plugin
* and it's fork: https://github.com/mati0090/Redmine-Issue-Checklist-Plugin

Seems like the functionality offered by the mod (copy checklist when issue is copied) was added to upstream:
>2.0.2 (2012-10-29)
>
>_Compatible with Redmine 2.1.x, 2.0.x._
>
>    Feature: Support for copying issues with checklist
